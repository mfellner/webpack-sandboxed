# Example

An example for how to use webpack-sandboxed. In this example we compile a string of JavaScript that implements a small React component and include the output as a `script` tag on a static HTML page.

In order to run the example, simply run `npm install` or `yarn install` in the root of the webpack-sandboxed project and then run `start` in this directory:

```
npm install
cd example && npm start
```
